# To-Do Project

Basic to-do list project using vanilla JS and CSS.
I wanted to see this project it on my GitHub. Because I think it so simple and effective project and something like indispensable among programmers. 


I used CSS and JavaScript. 
The todos you enter are registered in the local storage and when you delete the to-do's, it also deletes it from the UI and local storage.

I took care to write clean code. I hope I succeeded. And I would appreciate it if you could give me feedback on this matter.

Happy Codding
